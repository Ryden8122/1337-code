# 1337-code

This is a repo where I commit daily toy problems to.

Each toy problem is stored into it's own unique folder.

Each toy problem is an opportunity to practice AGILE work flow. Commiting to a development brach and pull requests handled per feature. 
In this case, each feature would be if there were a different way of solving the problem would be handled. Such as going from a for loop to a recursive function.
